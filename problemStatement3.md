## General explaination

This code creates a buffered channel cnp that can hold up to 10 function values. It then spawns four Go routines, each of which continuously receives values from the cnp channel and executes the received functions until the channel is closed. After creating the Go routines, the main program sends an anonymous function that prints "HERE1" to the cnp channel. However, since the main program exits immediately after sending the function, none of the Go routines have a chance to receive and execute it before the program terminates. As a result, "HERE1" is never printed to the console.
Now, let's go through the points you mentioned:

## Explaining the highlighted constructs:

make(chan func(), 10) creates a new buffered channel cnp that can hold up to 10 function values.
go func() {...}() creates an anonymous Go routine that runs concurrently with the main program.
for f := range cnp {...} is a range loop that receives values from the cnp channel and executes the received functions until the channel is closed.
cnp <- func() {...} sends an anonymous function to the cnp channel.


## Use-cases of these constructs:

Channels are used for communication and synchronization between Go routines, allowing them to send and receive values safely without data races.
Anonymous functions are useful when you need to define a function inline, often for passing it as an argument or returning it from another function.
Go routines enable concurrent execution of code, allowing for parallelism and efficient utilization of system resources.
Range loops over channels are commonly used to receive and process values from channels until the channel is closed.


## Significance of the for loop with 4 iterations:
The for i := 0; i < 4; i++ loop creates four separate Go routines that will run concurrently with the main program. Each Go routine executes the anonymous function func() { for f := range cnp {...} }(), which will block until a value is received from the cnp channel.
Significance of make(chan func(), 10):
This line creates a buffered channel cnp that can hold up to 10 function values. The 10 is the buffer capacity of the channel, which means that up to 10 function values can be sent to the channel without blocking the sender. If more than 10 values are sent, the sender will block until a receiver reads from the channel.
Why "HERE1" is not getting printed:
The line cnp <- func() { fmt.Println("HERE1") } sends an anonymous function to the cnp channel. However, none of the Go routines receive this value from the channel before the main program exits. The reason for this is that the main program terminates immediately after sending the function to the channel, without giving the Go routines a chance to execute and print "HERE1". To prevent this, you would need to introduce a mechanism to wait for the Go routines to complete before exiting the main program, such as using a sync.WaitGroup or blocking the main Go routine.
